NAME
    indirect - Lexically warn about using the indirect object syntax.

VERSION
    Version 0.07_02

SYNOPSIS
        no indirect;
        my $x = new Apple 1, 2, 3; # warns
        {
         use indirect;
         my $y = new Pear; # ok
        }
        no indirect ':fatal';
        if (defied $foo) { ... } # croaks, note the typo

DESCRIPTION
    When enabled (or disabled as some may prefer to say, since you actually
    turn it on by calling "no indirect"), this pragma warns about indirect
    object syntax constructs that may have slipped into your code. This
    syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing has many quirks and
    its use is error prone (when "sub" isn't defined, "sub $x" is actually
    interpreted as "$x->sub").

    It currently does not warn when the object is enclosed between braces
    (like "meth { $obj } @args") or for core functions ("print" or "say").
    This may change in the future, or may be added as optional features that
    would be enabled by passing options to "unimport".

    This module is not a source filter.

METHODS
  "unimport @opts"
    Magically called when "no indirect @opts" is encountered. Turns the
    module on. If @opts contains ':fatal', the module will croak on the
    first indirect syntax met.

  "import"
    Magically called at each "use indirect". Turns the module off.

DEPENDENCIES
    perl 5.9.4.

    XSLoader (standard since perl 5.006).
