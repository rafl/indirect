Revision history for indirect

0.02    2008-08-11 15:55 UTC
        + Fix : Some building failures with old gcc versions that didn't seem to
                like the ((hint == 2) ? croak : warn)(msg) construct. I think.
        + Rem : Unused cruft from a previous implementation.
        + Tst : Fail more gracefully when we can't capture buffers or when the
                child returned an error.
