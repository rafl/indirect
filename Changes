Revision history for indirect

0.06    2008-10-11 16:45 UTC
        + Doc : Nits.
        + Tst : Test "no indirect 'anything'", "foo Class->bar", and indirect
                uses of exec() and system().

0.05    2008-10-02 14:40 UTC
        + Chg : Now the old check function is always called before storing an op
                into the map.
        + Fix : Misc code and docs refinements.

0.04    2008-08-30 19:00 UTC
        + Fix : Clean up the op->src hash when we're done with an entersub.
        + Tst : No longer fork for testing. IPC::Cmd isn't required anymore.

0.03    2008-08-12 15:25 UTC
        This release is kindly supported by Copenhagen Hotel Centrum WiFi.
        + Fix : Tests used not to pass PERL5OPTS to their kids. This lead to
                failures under CPAN. I think.
        + Tst : Refinements.

0.02    2008-08-11 15:55 UTC
        + Fix : Some building failures with old gcc versions that didn't seem to
                like the ((hint == 2) ? croak : warn)(msg) construct. I think.
        + Rem : Unused cruft from a previous implementation.
        + Tst : Fail more gracefully when we can't capture buffers or when the
                child returned an error.
